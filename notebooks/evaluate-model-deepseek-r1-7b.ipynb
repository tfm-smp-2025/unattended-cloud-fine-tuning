            "Alright, so I need to extract the nouns from this natural language query: \"Which architect of Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay was also tenant of New Sanno hotel /'\". Okay, let's break it down step by step.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, I'll read through the sentence carefully. The main question is asking about an architect who worked at Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay and also was a tenant of New Sanno hotel. So, there are two key parts here: one related to the architect's role at the air station and another about their tenure at the hotel.\n",
            "\n",
            "Starting with \"Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay\". The word \"Marine\" is an adjective describing the type of institution, so I can skip that. Then \"Air Station\" is a noun phrase, but it's more like a location or place name here. However, since it's part of the query and not necessarily a standalone entity we're looking for, maybe I should consider if \"Kaneohe Bay\" is a noun. Kaneohe Bay is a specific area, so that could be considered a noun.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, the phrase \"architect of Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay\". The word \" architect\" here is clearly a noun because it's describing a role or profession. So \" architect\" should definitely be included in our list.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moving on to the second part: \"was also tenant of New Sanno hotel /'\". Here, \"tenant\" refers to someone who occupies a property, so that's more of an action than a noun. However, \"New Sanno hotel\" is a place or location where someone was a tenant. So \"New Sanno hotel\" would be the noun here.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, but I need to make sure if \"tenant\" itself counts as a noun. In this context, \"tenant\" is part of the verb phrase \"was also tenant\", so it's not a standalone noun. Therefore, we should focus on the nouns that are directly mentioned without being part of another word or prepositional phrase.\n",
            "\n",
            "So summarizing what I have so far: \"Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay\" might be considered as two separate entities—\"Marine Corps Air Station\" and \"Kaneohe Bay\"—but since they're connected, maybe it's better to treat them together. However, the query is about the architect of the entire station, not just a part of it.\n",
            "\n",
            "So focusing on the nouns: \"architect\" from \" architect\", \"New Sanno hotel\". Also, \"Kaneohe Bay\" as a location might be considered a noun because it's a place name.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, but in the query, it's \"Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay\", so maybe \"Kaneohe Bay\" is part of the station's name. So perhaps we should consider \"Kaneohe Bay\" as a separate entity or part of the station's name. But since the architect is associated with the entire station, not just the bay, maybe it's better to include \"Marine Corps Air Station\" as an entity.\n",
            "\n",
            "But I'm getting confused here because \"Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay\" seems like one place name. So perhaps we should treat that as a single noun phrase rather than splitting into two separate nouns.\n",
            "\n",
            "So in the query, the main entities are:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay (as a location)\n",
            "2. architect (as a profession or role)\n",
            "3. New Sanno hotel (as a place where someone was a tenant)\n",
            "\n",
            "But since \"Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay\" is part of the query, maybe it's better to consider it as one entity because it's referring to the same station.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, in terms of extracting nouns, we need to identify words that are standalone nouns. So \"architect\" and \"New Sanno hotel\" are clear nouns here. \"Kaneohe Bay\" is part of a larger noun phrase but might not be considered a separate entity unless it's being used as an adjective or noun on its own.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, no, in this context, \"Kaneohe Bay\" is part of the station's name, so maybe we don't need to extract it separately. The main focus is on the architect and the hotel.\n",
            "\n",
            "So perhaps the nouns are:\n",
            "\n",
            "- architect\n",
            "- New Sanno hotel\n",
            "\n",
            "But I'm not entirely sure if \"Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay\" counts as a noun because it's part of the query structure, but since it's referring to where the architect was associated, maybe we don't need to extract it unless it's an entity on its own.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alternatively, considering that \"Kaneohe Bay\" is a place name and could be considered a separate entity if it's not part of another word. But in this case, it's part of \"Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay\", so maybe we shouldn't split it.\n",
            "\n",
            "So to sum up, the nouns are:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. architect\n",
            "2. New Sanno hotel\n",
            "\n",
            "I think that's it because \"Kaneohe Bay\" is part of a larger noun phrase and not a standalone entity in this context.\n",

            "\n",
            "Then it says \"which fall under the International Muslim Brotherhood.\" The phrase \"fall under\" indicates possession, so the next word after that would be a noun. \n",

            "Okay, so I need to extract the nouns from the given natural language query: \"Is Peter Piper Pizza in the pizza industry?\" Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, I should understand what a noun is. Nouns are words that name people, places, things, or ideas. So, looking at each word in the sentence.\n",
            "\n",
            "Starting with \"Is\" – that's an auxiliary verb, not a noun. Next, \"Peter\" – that's a person's name, so definitely a noun. Then \"Piper\" – I think that could be a name as well, maybe like a pet or someone's name. So both Peter and Piper are nouns.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next is \"Pizza.\" Now, this can be tricky because it can refer to the food item or also be used as a proper noun if referring to a specific pizza place. But in this context, since we're talking about the industry, I think it's more likely referring to the food item. So Pizza would be another noun.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then \"in\" – that's a preposition, not a noun. Finally, \"the pizza industry.\" Here, \"pizza\" is part of an adjective phrase modifying \"industry,\" so \"industry\" itself is a noun, but since we're focusing on extracting nouns from the query, and \"pizza\" is already considered earlier, maybe we don't need to include \"industry\" unless it's a separate entity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, but in this case, the question is about whether Peter Piper Pizza is part of the pizza industry. So \"Peter,\" \"Piper,\" and \"Pizza\" are all nouns here. The phrase \"pizza industry\" includes \"pizza\" again, which we've already noted. But since we're extracting each noun individually, I think it's better to list them separately.\n",
            "\n",

In some cases, like \"Peter Piper,\" it might be part of a play or joke where it refers to a character. But in other contexts, especially when talking about pizza, it's likely just another name.\n",
            "4. **\"Pizza\"** – This is definitely a noun here because we're discussing pizza as the food item and its industry.\n",
            "5. **\"in\"** – Another preposition, not a noun.\n",

            "First, I'll read through the sentence carefully. The main question is asking for the name of an artist. So, the first noun here would be \"artist.\" That makes sense because they're specifically asking for someone's name who fits certain criteria.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next part: \"who made Dream Dancing.\" Here, \"Dream Dancing\" seems to be a title or name of something, probably a song or album.

            "\n",
            "Then, there's \"and is often associated with Joe Pass.\" Here, \"Joe Pass\" is another name or person. Since they're associating this artist with Joe Pass, \"Joe Pass\" would be an entity we need to consider as a noun.\n",
            "\n",
            "So putting it all together, the nouns are \"artist,\" \"Dream Dancing,\" and \"Joe Pass.\" But wait, I should check if any of these can be solved by SPARQL verbs.

            "Alright, so I need to extract the nouns from this natural language query: \"Where did these popular aeroplanes - Focke Wulf 260 and Start+Flug H 101 originate?\" \n",
            "\n",
            "First, let me break down the sentence. The user is asking about where two specific aeroplanes originated. The key parts here are \"aeroplanes\" which refers to planes, but more specifically, they're talking about Focke Wulf 260 and Start+Flug H 101.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "- \"Where\" is a question word, not a noun.\n",
            "- \"did\" is also a question particle, so it's not a noun.\n",
            "- \"these\" refers to the aeroplanes mentioned later, but since it's an indefinite pronoun, I think we can skip that as it doesn't add specific information beyond what's already given.\n",
            "- \"popular\" is an adjective describing \"aeroplanes.\"\n",
            "- \"aeroplanes\" is a noun. It's a type of plane, so definitely a noun here.\n",
            "- \"-\" is just a punctuation mark and not a word.\n",
            "- \"Focke Wulf 260\" is the name of a specific aeroplane model, so that's another noun.\n",
            "- \"and\" is a conjunction, so it doesn't count as a noun.\n",
            "- \"Start+Flug H 101\" seems to be another model name. The \"+\" might indicate something like a variant or a different part of the name, but regardless, it's still a specific aeroplane.\n",
            "\n",
            "So putting that together, the nouns are \"aeroplanes,\" \"Focke Wulf 260,\" and \"Start+Flug H 101.\" \n",
            "\n",
            "I should also consider if any of these can be solved by a SPARQL verb. The user mentioned to ignore verbs like \"count\" or \"number of,\" but in this case, we're just extracting nouns, so none of them are verbs that would require solving with SPARQL.\n",

            "Alright, so I need to extract the nouns from the given natural language query. The query is: \"Which television show 's producer is Stephen E. Ambrose and written by Erik Jendresen?\" \n",
            "\n",
            "First, I should break down the sentence into parts to identify each noun. Nouns are typically words that name people, places, things, or ideas.\n",
            "\n",
            "Starting with the first part: \"Which television show's producer...\" Here, \"television show\" is definitely a noun because it refers to a type of program. Then, \"producer\" is another noun since it's a person who produces something.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, in the second part: \"...Stephen E. Ambrose and written by...\" The name \"Stephen E. Ambrose\" is clearly a noun as it refers to a specific individual. Similarly, \"Erik Jendresen\" is also a noun because it's another person's name.\n",
            "\n",
            "I should make sure not to include any verbs or other parts of speech that aren't nouns. For example, words like \"is,\" \"and,\" \"written\" are verbs and can be ignored for this task.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, compiling the list, I have three nouns: television show, producer, Stephen E. Ambrose, and Erik Jendresen. Wait, but looking back at the query, it's asking about the producer of a television show written by another person. So maybe \"written\" is also relevant as it refers to the act of writing, which could be considered a noun.\n",
            "\n",
            "But in this case, since we're focusing on extracting nouns that are entities, perhaps \"written\" isn't an entity but more of an action verb. So I should stick with the names and the titles rather than verbs like \"is,\" \"and,\" or \"written.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Therefore, the final list includes \"television show,\" \"producer,\" \"Stephen E. Ambrose,\" and \"Erik Jendresen.\" But wait, in the initial breakdown, I thought of three nouns: television show, producer, Stephen E. Ambrose, and Erik Jendresen. However, considering that \"written\" is a verb, it's not included.\n",
            "\n",
            "But looking again at the query structure: \"Which television show's producer is Stephen E. Ambrose...\" So \"television show\" is one noun, \"producer\" another, then we have two names: Stephen and Erik. So in total, four nouns? Or maybe three if considering that \"television show's producer\" could be considered as a single entity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The query is asking for the television show whose producer is Stephen E. Ambrose and who wrote it is Erik Jendresen. So each of these entities (television show, producer, writer) are separate nouns.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "So, I constructed the SPARQL query using `SELECT` to retrieve the `show_name` where there exists a producer named Stephen E. Ambrose and a written_by named Erik Jendresen for the same show. The query uses `?p <http://dbpedia.org/property/producers_of>` to link producers to the show and `?w <http://dbpedia.org/property/written_by>` to link writers.\n",

            "Okay, so I need to extract the nouns from this natural language query: \"Who created the Women in the Garden and also the L'Enfant a la tasse ?\". Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, I should understand what the user is asking. They're asking about who created two things: \"the Women in the Garden\" and \"the L'Enfant a la tasse.\" So, they want to know the creators of these two entities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, looking at the query, there are four nouns here: \"Who,\" \"created,\" \"Women,\" \"in,\" \"the,\" \"Garden,\" \"and,\" \"also,\" \"the,\" \"L'Enfant,\" \"a,\" \"la,\" \"tasse.\" Wait, but not all of these are actual nouns. Some words like \"who\" and \"created\" are pronouns and verbs respectively.\n",
            "\n",
            "So I need to identify the nouns specifically. Nouns are usually people, places, things, or ideas. In this case, the query is about creators, so we're looking for names or entities that created something.\n",
            "\n",
            "Looking at \"Women in the Garden,\" it's likely a person or group of people who created an artwork or garden design. So \"Women\" could be one noun here, but actually, \"Women in the Garden\" might refer to a specific entity, maybe like a person or a project. But since it's written as a phrase, I'm not sure if that counts as a single noun.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then there's \"L'Enfant a la tasse.\" That sounds French. \"L'Enfant\" means \"child,\" and \"a la tasse\" is an expression meaning \"with tea.\" So together, it might be referring to a child who enjoys tea or perhaps a specific artwork titled \"L'Enfant a la Tasse.\" In this context, the noun would likely be \"L'Enfant a la Tasse.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, but in French, \"L'Enfant\" is a noun on its own. So maybe both \"Women\" and \"L'Enfant\" are nouns here.\n",
            "\n",
            "But I'm not entirely sure if \"Women in the Garden\" counts as a single noun or multiple. Since it's one phrase, perhaps it refers to an entity that created something, so maybe we can consider it as a collective noun for the group of women who did it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alternatively, maybe each part is separate: \"Women,\" \"in,\" \"the,\" etc., but those are prepositions and articles, not nouns. So focusing on the main parts: \"Women in the Garden\" could be considered as one entity if we're talking about a specific person or group that created something, so perhaps \"Women in the Garden\" is treated as a single noun.\n",
            "\n",
            "Similarly, \"L'Enfant a la tasse\" might refer to an artwork or piece of work, so maybe it's better to consider each main noun separately: \"Women,\" \"Garden,\" \"L'Enfant,\" and \"tasse.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "But wait, the user wants to extract nouns that can't be solved by SPARQL verbs like \"count\" or \"number of.\" So we need to make sure these are actual entities.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, considering all this, I think the main nouns here are:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Women in the Garden – as a collective noun for the group.\n",
            "2. L'Enfant a la tasse – which could be an artwork, so maybe it's better to split into \"L'Enfant\" and \"tasse,\" but since they're connected by an expression, perhaps treating them together.\n",
            "\n",
            "But I'm not entirely sure if \"Women in the Garden\" is considered one noun or multiple. Maybe splitting it as \"Garden\" and \"Women.\" But \"Garden\" might be more of a place rather than a person.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alternatively, maybe focusing on the main entities: \"Women,\" \"L'Enfant,\" and \"tasse.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, but in French, \"L'Enfant a la tasse\" is an expression meaning \"child with tea,\" so it's not necessarily referring to an artwork. Maybe that's more of a descriptive phrase rather than a noun.\n",
            "\n",
            "So perhaps the only nouns here are \"Women\" and \"L'Enfant.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "But I'm getting confused now. Let me try again.\n",
            "\n",
            "The query is: Who created the Women in the Garden and also the L'Enfant a la tasse ?\n",
            "\n",
            "Breaking it down:\n",
            "\n",
            "- \"Who created\" – so we're looking for who did something.\n",
            "- Then two things: \"the Women in the Garden\" and \"the L'Enfant a la tasse.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "So, each of these is an entity that was created. So \"Women in the Garden\" could be considered as one entity (maybe a person or group), and \"L'Enfant a la tasse\" might refer to another entity.\n",
            "\n",
            "But I'm not sure if \"Women in the Garden\" is treated as a single noun or multiple nouns like \"Women,\" \"Garden.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Similarly, \"L'Enfant a la tasse\" could be split into \"L'Enfant\" and \"tasse,\" but again, it's an expression.\n",
            "\n",
            "So perhaps the best approach is to extract each main noun: \"Women,\" \"Garden,\" \"L'Enfant,\" and \"tasse.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Maybe \"Women in the Garden\" should be treated as a single entity because they're connected, so it would be one noun.\n",
            "\n",
            "Similarly, \"L'Enfant a la tasse\" might be considered as two separate entities: \"L'Enfant\" and \"tasse,\" but since they are part of an expression, maybe not.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alternatively, perhaps the query is referring to two specific works or pieces created by someone. So if we're looking for who created them, then each work would have its own creator.\n",
            "\n",
            "But in this case, it's asking about the creators of both \"the Women in the Garden\" and \"the L'Enfant a la tasse.\" So maybe each is an entity that was created, so their creators are separate entities.\n",
            "\n",
            "So perhaps we should extract:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Women\n",
            "2. Garden\n",
            "3. L'Enfant\n",
            "4. Tasse\n",
            "\n",
            "But I'm not sure if \"Garden\" and \"Tasse\" are considered as separate nouns here because they might be parts of the works rather than standalone entities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alternatively, maybe only \"Women,\" \"L'Enfant,\" and \"tasse\" are the main nouns.\n",
            "\n",
            "I think I need to make a decision based on this. Let's go with extracting each main noun from the phrases:\n",
            "\n",
            "- From \"Women in the Garden\": \"Women\"\n",
            "- From \"L'Enfant a la tasse\": \"L'Enfant\"\n",
            "\n",
            "But wait, maybe \"Garden\" and \"tasse\" are also nouns because they're part of the entities.\n",
            "\n",
            "So perhaps it's better to include them as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "Therefore, the final list would be:\n",
            "\n",
            "[\n",
            "    \"Women\",\n",
            "    \"Garden\",\n",
            "    \"L'Enfant\",\n",
            "    \"tasse\"\n",
            "]\n",
            "\n",
            "But I'm still a bit unsure about including \"Garden\" and \"tasse.\" Maybe they are more like locations or objects rather than people. So perhaps only \"Women\" and \"L'Enfant\" are the actual nouns referring to people who created something.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alternatively, if we consider each part of the phrases separately:\n",
            "\n",
            "- \"Women in the Garden\": \"Women,\" \"Garden\"\n",
            "- \"L'Enfant a la tasse\": \"L'Enfant,\" \"tasse\"\n",
            "\n",
            "So that would give us four nouns: Women, Garden, L'Enfant, tasse.\n",
            "\n",
            "But I'm not sure if \"Garden\" and \"tasse\" are considered as separate entities or parts of the works. Maybe it's better to include them since they're part of the phrases referring to created things.\n",
